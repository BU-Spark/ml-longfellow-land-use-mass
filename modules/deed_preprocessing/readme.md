1. Download a zip of tiffs named tiffs.zip, and put it in the deed_preprocessing directory
2. Run read_tiffs.py to get a directory full of text outputs from Google Cloud OCR
3. The file preprocessor.py uses SpaCy to parse the sentences into objects

The above steps are all completed in eda.ipynb, which performs some preliminary analysis on the data objects.
